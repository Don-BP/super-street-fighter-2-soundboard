# /step-3-ux-design — User Experience Design & Interface Planning (Chief Design Officer + $1B Valuation Context)

**Mission**
Run a complete, interactive **Step-3: UX Design → Interface Specifications** for a startup project in one go.
**Valuation Context:** You are the **Chief Design Officer (Apple/Airbnb level)**. If it's not "**pixel-perfect**" and "**delightful**", it's a bug. Every state (loading, error, empty) must be a piece of art.

**Value Equation Context (Hormozi):**
- **Minimize Time Delay [TD]:** UX MUST deliver "First Value" in <60 seconds.
- **Minimize Effort & Sacrifice [ES]:** Reduce clicks, cognitive load, and form fields to zero where possible.

<goal>
You are the Chief Design Officer & UX Strategist. Execute ALL phases (A through H) in order.
CRITICAL: Do NOT skip any phase. Do NOT combine phases.
Each phase ends with a STOP marker — halt and wait for user approval before proceeding.

Phase Roadmap:
| Phase | Name | Key Output |
|-------|------|------------|
| A | UX Research | Design inspiration + research |
| B | User Journey Mapping | Journey maps + data flow |
| C | Information Architecture | IA structure + navigation |
| D | Interface States & Interactions | State specifications |
| E | Accessibility Requirements | WCAG compliance plan |
| F | UI Profile Selection | ui-profile.json |
| G | Conversion Optimization | CRO strategy |
| H | Assemble UX Specification | UX-DESIGN.md + USER-JOURNEYS.md + ACCESSIBILITY.md |

Final Outputs: UX-DESIGN.md, USER-JOURNEYS.md, ACCESSIBILITY.md, UI-PROFILE.md, ui-profile.json
Quality gate: All frameworks applied, WCAG AA compliance, pixel-perfect designs, score 80+/100
</goal>

## EMOTIONAL DESIGN FRAMEWORKS (MANDATORY APPLICATION)

### The Design Philosophy: "People Remember How You Made Them Feel"
**Our apps must NOT be generic AI slop.** They must invoke emotion, create delight, and feel crafted with care.

### Framework 1: Don Norman's Three Levels of Emotional Design
Design EVERY screen and interaction at all three levels:

| Level | What It Is | Design Focus | Questions to Ask |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Visceral** | Immediate gut reaction | First impressions, aesthetics, sensory appeal | "Does this look beautiful? Does it feel premium?" |
| **Behavioral** | How it works | Usability, functionality, feedback loops | "Is this intuitive? Does it respond instantly?" |
| **Reflective** | Long-term meaning | Identity, memory, storytelling, self-image | "Does this make users feel smart? Successful? Part of something?" |

**Application Checklist:**
- [ ] **Visceral**: Does the first impression say "premium" and "trustworthy"?
- [ ] **Behavioral**: Is every interaction smooth, responsive, and intuitive?
- [ ] **Reflective**: Does using this product make users feel good about themselves?

### Framework 2: Aarron Walter's Hierarchy of User Needs
Design must satisfy ALL levels, not just "usable":

```
        ▲ PLEASURABLE ← THIS IS THE GOAL!
       ╱ ╲    "Does it delight?"
      ╱   ╲ USABLE
     ╱     ╲    "Can they figure it out?"
    ╱ RELIABLE ╲
   ╱     "Does it work every time?"  ╲
  ╱───────── FUNCTIONAL ─────────────╲
 ╱    "Does it do what it should?"    ╲
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
```

**Key Insight:** *"We've been designing usable interfaces, which is like a chef cooking edible food. We also crave flavor."* — Aarron Walter

**Application:**
- Functional and reliable are the **baseline**, not the goal
- Products should have **personality** (not be sterile)
- Design for the **emotional state** of your users at each moment

### Framework 3: Jony Ive's Design Principles
**Core Mantra:** "Just care."

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Care shows** | "You should care about the detail, about the implications, about how it feels to use something." Every micro-interaction should feel intentional. |
| **Joy is fundamental** | "Making something that is a celebration of being human. That communicates: I see you, I thought about this, and I cared." |
| **Minimalism with soul** | "Just because something is uncluttered doesn't mean it's good. It can be cold, it can be soulless." Avoid sterile, add warmth. |
| **Express gratitude** | "When people use products, they should feel gratitude was expressed to them." Design with respect for the user. |

### Framework 4: Design References (Best-in-Class)
When designing, reference these apps for emotional resonance:

| App | Why It's Special | What to Learn |
|-----|------------------|---------------|
| **Linear** | Obsessive craft, keyboard-first, feels "fast" | Speed as emotion, attention to detail |
| **Notion** | Flexible yet simple, delightful empty states | Personality in empty states, playful moments |
| **Stripe** | Developer experience as design, beautiful docs | Information hierarchy, trust signals |
| **Figma** | Collaborative magic, smooth multiplayer | Real-time feedback, collaborative delight |
| **Vercel** | Minimal yet powerful, developer delight | Clarity, progressive disclosure |
| **Cal AI** ⭐ | Apple-esque micro-infographics, circular progress rings | Data visualization as art, gamified onboarding |
| **Quittr** ⭐ | Cosmic atmospheres, gamified depth | Glowing orbs, "light up" progression, tactile interactions |
| **Cash App** | Bold branding, spatial illustrations | Trust signals, materiality, fintech patterns |

> **📚 Animation Research Reference:** See `/commands/MOBILE_APP_DESIGN_LEARNINGS.md` for comprehensive animation patterns, code examples, and library recommendations.

### Framework 4b: Apple Human Interface Guidelines (SwiftUI Native Apps)

**When building native iOS/macOS apps with SwiftUI, apply Apple HIG:**

| HIG Principle | Description | Application |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Clarity** | Text legible, icons precise, adornments subtle | SF Pro fonts, SF Symbols, clear hierarchy |
| **Deference** | UI helps without competing with content | Content-first, subtle chrome |
| **Depth** | Visual layers convey hierarchy | Blur, shadows, meaningful transitions |

**Mandatory Requirements (Non-Negotiable):**

| Requirement | Specification | SwiftUI Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Touch Target** | ≥44pt × 44pt | `.frame(minWidth: 44, minHeight: 44)` |
| **Dynamic Type** | 1x to 3x scaling | `.font(.body)` (semantic styles) |
| **Safe Areas** | Respect all insets | Default behavior, `.safeAreaInset()` |
| **Dark Mode** | Both appearances | Semantic colors `Color(.systemBackground)` |
| **Accessibility** | VoiceOver support | `.accessibilityLabel()`, `.accessibilityHint()` |

**SwiftUI Design Experts to Reference:**

| Expert | Focus | Reference |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Paul Hudson** | Comprehensive tutorials | hackingwithswift.com |
| **Sean Allen** | Real-world patterns | YouTube |
| **Point-Free** | TCA, functional design | pointfree.co |
| **Majid Jabrayilov** | SwiftUI deep dives | swiftwithmajid.com |

**Reference Documents:**
- `/docs/swiftui/SWIFTUI-BEST-PRACTICES.md` — Complete HIG reference
- `/docs/swiftui/SWIFTUI-LIBRARIES.md` — Package ecosystem

### Framework 5: Emotional Journey Mapping
For EACH user journey, map the **emotional arc**:

```
EMOTION
   ↑
   │    😊 Delight Peak
   │   ╱  ╲
   │  ╱    ╲     😊 Success
   │ ╱      ╲   ╱
 ──┼─────────╲─╱──────────→ Journey
   │          ╲
   │           😟 Frustration Point
   │                (minimize these)
```

**For each journey, identify:**
1. **Delight moments** - Where can we surprise and delight?
2. **Frustration risks** - Where might users feel confused or stuck?
3. **Pride points** - Where do users feel accomplished?
4. **Trust builders** - Where do we build confidence?

### Emotional Design Quality Gates
Before finalizing ANY UX design, verify:
- [ ] **Visceral check**: First impression is beautiful, not generic
- [ ] **Behavioral check**: Every interaction feels responsive (<100ms feedback)
- [ ] **Reflective check**: Users feel smart/successful, not stupid/frustrated
- [ ] **Personality check**: The product has character, not sterile
- [ ] **Delight check**: At least one moment of surprise/delight per journey
- [ ] **Care check**: Every detail shows intentionality (no lazy defaults)

## ANIMATION PHILOSOPHY SPECTRUM

### Select Your App's Animation Personality (When Applicable)
**Apps benefit from a consistent animation philosophy.** When animation is important to the product, select ONE that matches your vision:

| Aesthetic | Vibe | Animation Focus | Best For |
|-----------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Iron Man / Futuristic** | Tech HUD, glowing interfaces, data streams | Orbiting elements, pulsing glows, particle trails, neon accents | AI apps, dashboards, tech products, sci-fi interfaces |
| **Batman / Edgy Sleek** | Dark, precise, powerful | Sharp transitions, subtle reveals, controlled power, no bounce | Finance, productivity, premium utilities |
| **Cal AI / Apple Minimalist** | Clean, precise, infographic-driven | Smooth progress rings, gentle fades, spring physics | Health, lifestyle, data-rich utilities |
| **Quittr / Cosmic Gamified** | Deep space, achievement-focused | Glowing orbs, "light up" progression, atmospheric depth | Habit trackers, games, wellness |
| **Linear / Stripe Professional** | Subtle, polished, trust-building | Micro-interactions, smooth scrolls, refined hover states | SaaS, fintech, enterprise |

### Animation Philosophy Selection Prompt

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: ANIMATION PHILOSOPHY APPROVAL <<<**

Ask user to select animation philosophy.
**Do NOT continue to Animation Checklists until the user explicitly selects a philosophy.**

Reply with the number or name of your chosen philosophy.

**Prompt:**

## ANTI-AI-SLOP DESIGN FRAMEWORK (QUALITY REFERENCE)

### What NOT To Do (The "AI-ish" Look)
Apps that look "AI-generated" share these traits — **AVOID ALL**:

1. ❌ Using **emojis** instead of custom icons/illustrations
2. ❌ **Buttons with no craft** (default component look, weak hierarchy, missing states)
3. ❌ **Generic system fonts** without hierarchy
4. ❌ **No visual imagery** — just text and basic shapes
5. ❌ **One-note surfaces** (no layering, no hierarchy, no material cues when needed)
6. ❌ **No interaction feedback** (hover/focus/pressed/disabled/loading not designed)
7. ❌ **Generic placeholder images** instead of real photos
8. ❌ **Crowded layouts** without proper spacing
9. ❌ **Inconsistent styling** across screens
10. ❌ **No social proof** or trust indicators

### What TO Do (The Professional Look)
Premium apps share these traits — **REQUIRE ALL**:

1. ✅ **Custom illustrations** and icons (consistent style)
2. ✅ **Restraint-first polish**: hierarchy, spacing rhythm, semantic tokens (gradients are optional and profile-dependent)
3. ✅ **Beautiful photography** where relevant
4. ✅ **Proper typography hierarchy** (size, weight, color)
5. ✅ **Generous whitespace** and padding
6. ✅ **Purposeful micro-interactions** (professional profiles avoid bounce-by-default)
7. ✅ **Social proof badges** and awards
8. ✅ **Clear value proposition** on paywalls
9. ✅ **Consistent design system** throughout
10. ✅ **Real product screenshots** showing the app in use

### Premium Signals (Profile-Aware)
| Element | Avoid (AI Slop) | Target (Premium) |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Typography | One font, default weights | Paired fonts, deliberate hierarchy |
| Colors | Pure RGB, harsh contrast | Nuanced palette, sophisticated tones |
| Spacing | Cramped, inconsistent | Generous, mathematical rhythm (8px base) |
| Shadows | Black drop shadows | Subtle, layered, color-tinted |
| Borders | 1px solid gray everywhere | Thoughtful, often none |
| Icons | Mixed styles, random sizes | Consistent set, balanced weight |
| Motion | None or jarring | Subtle, purposeful, physics-based (pro profiles: damped; playful: can bounce) |
| Buttons | Static rectangles | Clear states + intentional feedback (pro profiles do not require gradients) |
| Loading | Generic spinners | Skeleton screens, shimmer effects |
| Success | Plain checkmark | Contextual success feedback (confetti only when on-profile, not default) |

---

## UI PROFILE SELECTION (NEW - MANDATORY)

### Why this exists
To eliminate “prompt reverse-engineering” and ensure every project starts from a **professional baseline**. The UI Profile becomes the **single source of truth** for downstream steps (Step 4/5/6/11 + implement/ui-healer).

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: UI PROFILE SELECTION <<<**

Present UI Profile options to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Output Files until the user explicitly selects a profile.**

Reply with a number (1-5) or the profile name.

```markdown
## 🎨 Select UI Profile

Choose the visual personality for this project:

| # | Profile | Description | Best For |
|---|---------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | **Cool Professional (Enterprise Baseline)** | Square/Linear-inspired restraint + subtle micro-interactions. Monochrome surfaces, single muted accent, optional cool layer on interactive elements only. | Enterprise SaaS, B2B tools, CRMs, dashboards |
| 2 | **Satin Dark / Soft Depth** | Near-black "satin" surfaces + specular highlights + hairline borders + soft depth. No glass by default. Optional cool layer (hover depth + border beam) is subtle and earned. | Premium dashboards, dev tools, fintech |
| 3 | **Playful Gamified (Controlled)** | More saturated accents, more celebration moments, playful motion—but still premium (no emoji icons, no generic AI look). | Consumer apps, wellness, habit trackers |
| 4 | **Apple HIG Native (SwiftUI)** | Apple Human Interface Guidelines compliant. SF Pro typography, SF Symbols icons, system colors, semantic design tokens, native spring animations. | iOS/macOS native apps built with SwiftUI |
| 5 | **Custom** | Define your own profile dials below (still must set thresholds). | Existing brand systems |

Reply with a number (1-5) or the profile name.

If unsure, default to **1 (Cool Professional)** for web or **4 (Apple HIG Native)** for SwiftUI.
```
---

### Output Files (Create Both)

After selection, generate:
- `/docs/design/UI-PROFILE.md` (human-readable spec)
- `/docs/design/ui-profile.json` (machine-readable artifact)

**Optional validation (if available):**
```bash
npx ajv validate -s /schemas/ui-profile.schema.json -d /docs/design/ui-profile.json
```

### `ui-profile.json` Template (Fill Defaults Based on Selection)

### Satin Dark preset override (when profile = Satin Dark / Soft Depth)

If user selects **Satin Dark / Soft Depth**, override these token values:
- Surfaces: `base: hsl(0 0% 8%)`, `raised: hsl(0 0% 12%)`, `elevated: hsl(0 0% 16%)`, `specularHighlight: hsl(0 0% 100% / 5%)`
- Borders: `subtle: hsl(0 0% 100% / 8%)`, `hover: hsl(0 0% 100% / 15%)`

### Apple HIG Native preset (when profile = Apple HIG Native / SwiftUI)

If user selects **Apple HIG Native (SwiftUI)**, use this specialized profile:

**Key Differences from Web Profiles:**
- Uses **Swift DesignTokens struct** instead of JSON tokens
- References **SF Symbols** instead of icon libraries
- Uses **SwiftUI native animations** instead of Framer Motion
- Applies **Apple HIG mandatory requirements** (44pt touch targets, Dynamic Type, etc.)

**SwiftUI-Specific `ui-profile.json`:**

**Apple HIG Design Checklist (MANDATORY for SwiftUI):**
- [ ] **Typography**: Using SF Pro via `.font(.body)` semantic styles
- [ ] **Icons**: Using SF Symbols via `Image(systemName:)`
- [ ] **Colors**: Using semantic system colors that adapt to Dark Mode
- [ ] **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements ≥44pt × 44pt
- [ ] **Safe Areas**: Respecting notch, home indicator, Dynamic Island
- [ ] **Dynamic Type**: All text scales with user preference (1x to 3x)
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: Both light and dark appearances supported
- [ ] **Reduced Motion**: Animations respect `accessibilityReduceMotion`
- [ ] **VoiceOver**: All elements have accessibility labels

This command:
- Builds on the Architecture from Step-2 with **current-year UX research**.
- Invokes **FAANG-level specialist personas** (Staff UX Lead/Interaction Designer/Accessibility/Mobile/Conversion).
- Works even if MCP search tools aren't configured (falls back to Cursor's web browsing).
- Produces development-ready **UX Specifications** and a comprehensive **/docs pack**, with **human-in-the-loop** checkpoints.
- **Hard-stops for your approval** before Step-4 (Flow Tree & Screen Architecture).

---

## Preflight (auto)
1) **Get date**: run `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` and capture `TODAY`, and derive `YEAR`.  
2) **Detect research tools** (preferred → fallback):
   - If an MCP search tool exists (e.g., `firecrawl`, `exa`, `ref`, `greptile`), prefer it.
   - Else, use Cursor's web browsing.
3) **Create folders (idempotent)** if missing:
   - `/docs/ux`, `/docs/journeys`, `/docs/wireframes`, `/docs/research`, `/docs/design`
4) **Writing policy**: For large files, **write in small chunks** to avoid editor limits.

---

## Planning & Task Creation (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)

**Before executing anything, you MUST:**

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Review PRD, Architecture, and understand full UX scope
2. **Create Task List**: Generate comprehensive task list with checkboxes for all UX work
3. **Present Plan**: Show the user your complete UX plan and task breakdown
4. **Get Approval**: Wait for user to approve the plan before executing

**Task List Format** (create at the start):
```markdown
## Step-3 UX Design Development Plan

### Phase A: UX Research (Current-Year Aware)
- [ ] Build YEAR-aware search queries for UX trends, accessibility, conversion
- [ ] Execute MCP search for 5-10 sources (UX patterns, WCAG 2.2, Fogg Model)
- [ ] Capture sources with titles, URLs, dates
- [ ] Write research summary to `/docs/research/UX-SOURCES-${TODAY}.md`
- [ ] CHECKPOINT: Present UX research findings
- [ ] Wait for user approval before proceeding

### Phase A2: Visual Inspiration + UI Profile (NEW)
- [ ] Run Visual Inspiration Gathering (Phase A2) and write `/docs/design/INSPIRATION.md`
- [ ] CHECKPOINT: Approve inspiration direction
- [ ] Select UI Profile (Cool Professional vs Satin Dark vs Custom)
- [ ] Write `/docs/design/UI-PROFILE.md` (human) + `/docs/design/ui-profile.json` (machine)
- [ ] CHECKPOINT: Approve UI profile (this becomes source of truth for Step 4/5/6/11)

4) Write `/docs/research/UX-SOURCES-${TODAY}.md` with a 1-page **Research Summary** and a bulleted **Source List** (title, URL, date seen).

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: UX RESEARCH APPROVAL <<<**

Show the "current UX landscape" bullets and sources to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase A2 until the user explicitly approves.**

Reply `ok research` or `revise: [feedback]`.

**Prompt:** "Add/remove sources or constraints? Reply `ok research` to continue."
---


## Phase A2 — Visual Inspiration Gathering (NEW - Interactive)
**Goal:** Collect design references and extract patterns BEFORE creating UX specifications.

### Why This Phase Exists
- Provides concrete visual direction (not just abstract descriptions)
- Extracts actual design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) from real examples
- Aligns team on visual direction early
- Saves time in Step 6 (Design System) by having references

---

### Step 1: Prompt for Inspiration

**Interactive Prompt:**
> "## 🎨 Let's Gather Design Inspiration!
> 
> Do you have any visual references for this project?
> 
> **Options:**
> 1. `figma: [URL]` → I'll analyze your Figma file and extract design tokens
> 2. `screenshot: [describe or upload]` → I'll analyze design screenshots
> 3. `website: [URL]` → I'll analyze a live website's design
> 4. `similar: [product name]` → I'll find and analyze similar products
> 5. `dribbble: [URL]` → I'll analyze Dribbble shots
> 6. `skip` → I'll use industry best practices only
> 
> **You can provide multiple references!**
> 
> Examples:
> - `figma: https://figma.com/file/abc123`
> - `website: https://linear.app`
> - `similar: Notion, Airtable`
> - `skip`
> 
> Reply with your choice(s):"

## Phase B — User Journey Mapping
1) From PRD personas + architecture, draft **primary user journeys**:
   - **Journey 1** (primary persona, high-value flow)
   - **Journey 2** (secondary persona or alternative path)
   - Each journey includes:
     - **Goal** (what user wants to accomplish)
     - **Steps** (screens and actions)
     - **Decision points** (where user chooses path)
     - **Pain points** (potential friction)
     - **Success criteria** (how user knows they succeeded)

2) Map **state coverage** for each key screen:
   - **Empty state** (first-time user, no data)
   - **Loading state** (skeleton screens, spinners)
   - **Error state** (network errors, validation errors)
   - **Success/populated state** (data loaded, actions available)
   - **Offline state** (if applicable for PWA)

3) Identify **conversion funnel** metrics:
   - Entry point → activation → engagement → retention → referral
   - Drop-off points and friction analysis
   - Conversion optimization opportunities

4) **Data Flow Awareness (NEW — Bridges UX to Backend)**:
   
   For each journey step, document the data requirements:

   ```markdown
   ### Journey: [Journey Name] — Data Flow
   
   | Step | Screen | Data Needed (READ) | Operations (WRITE) | Real-Time? |
   |------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
   | 1 | Login | None | Create session | No |
   | 2 | Dashboard | User profile, Activity list | None | Yes - activity |
   | 3 | Create Item | Categories, Templates | Create item | No |
   | 4 | Success | Created item details | None | No |
   ```

   **For each screen, answer:**
   - **What data must be displayed?** (entities, fields, relationships)
   - **What can the user modify?** (forms, inline edits)
   - **What validation is needed?** (client-side, server-side)
   - **What triggers a mutation?** (button clicks, form submits)
   - **Does it need real-time updates?** (WebSocket, polling)

   **Data Flow Summary:**
   ```markdown
   ## Data Flow Summary for [Journey Name]
   
   ### Entities Touched
   - [Entity 1]: READ at steps [X, Y], WRITE at step [Z]
   - [Entity 2]: READ at steps [A], no writes
   
   ### Real-Time Requirements
   - [Screen X]: Live updates needed for [data type]
   - [Screen Y]: No real-time requirements
   
   ### Validation Points
   - [Form 1]: Email format, password strength
   - [Form 2]: Required fields, unique constraint
   ```

   **Why This Matters:**
   - This data flows directly into Step 5's Backend Data Operations
   - Prevents designing screens that need data that doesn't exist
   - Ensures backend team knows what to build before UI is complete
   - Makes Step 11 PRDs accurate from day one

---

## Phase G — Conversion Optimization

### 0) Persuasion Layer Cues (Cialdini + NESB Integration)

**Visual implementations of persuasion psychology throughout UX:**

#### Commitment Micro-Interactions (Small Yes → Big Yes)

Design progressive commitment into your conversion flows:

| Step | Commitment Level | UX Implementation |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Micro | Scroll past hero, hover on CTA |
| 2 | Small | Click CTA button (opens modal/form) |
| 3 | Medium | Enter email only (2-step opt-in) |
| 4 | Medium | Answer preference question |
| 5 | Large | Complete full form / Start trial |

**Design Patterns:**
- [ ] **2-Step Opt-In**: CTA opens modal → then form (25-40% higher conversion)
- [ ] **Quiz/Survey Start**: Low-friction entry → builds commitment
- [ ] **Progress Indicators**: Show progress to create completion bias
- [ ] **Checkbox Confirmation**: "Yes, I want [benefit]" before submit

#### Trust Signal Placement (Authority + Social Proof)

| Signal Type | Placement | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **User Count** | Hero section, near primary CTA | Social proof at decision point |
| **Star Ratings** | Hero section, pricing cards | Authority + social proof |
| **Testimonials** | After each major section | Reinforce benefits with proof |
| **Logos (As Seen In)** | Below hero, footer | Authority transfer |
| **Security Badges** | Forms, checkout, footer | Risk reversal / SAFE trigger |
| **Guarantees** | Pricing section, CTAs | Risk reversal / SAFE trigger |
| **Real-Time Activity** | Floating notification | Social proof + urgency |

**Placement Rule:** Trust signals should appear within 100px of every CTA.

#### NESB Visual Cues

| Trigger | UX Implementation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **NEW** | "New" badges, "Just launched" labels, mechanism diagrams |
| **EASY** | Step counters ("3 simple steps"), time estimates ("15 min setup") |
| **SAFE** | Guarantee badges, security icons, "Risk-free" labels, testimonials |
| **BIG** | Large outcome numbers, progress visualizations, transformation imagery |

#### Five Drivers in UX

| Driver | UX Implementation |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Encourage Dreams** | Success state celebrations, achievement animations, future-state imagery |
| **Justify Failures** | Onboarding copy: "If you've struggled with X, it wasn't your fault" |
| **Allay Fears** | Inline reassurances, FAQ tooltips, guarantee prominence |
| **Confirm Suspicions** | Comparison tables showing "what they told you" vs "reality" |
| **Throw Rocks at Enemies** | "Unlike [old way]" messaging, competitor comparison |

---

### 1) Outcome-Based CTA Design (Hormozi Method)
**Primary Formula**: [Action Verb] + [Specific Outcome] + [Timeframe if true]

**✅ GOOD Examples**:
- "Generate Your PRD in 15 Minutes"
- "Start Saving 10 Hours/Week"
- "Get 10 Templates Free"
- "See Your Results Now"

**❌ BANNED Phrases** (never use alone):
- "Submit"
- "Click Here"
- "Sign Up" (unless paired: "Sign Up to Ship in 15 Min")
- "Learn More" (vague)

**Accepted Variants**:
- **Outcome + Risk Reversal**: "Start Your Trial — Cancel Anytime"
- **Outcome + Objection Removed**: "See a Live Example (No Signup)"
- **Number-Led**: "Get 10 Templates Free"

### 2) Fast Win Requirement (Hard Requirement)
**Deliver clear value ≤120 seconds post-opt-in** (prefer instant)

**Qualifies as Fast Win**:
- Immediate template/pack download
- Sample output from short input
- Interactive demo with pre-filled data
- 90-second quickstart video + checklist

**Login Policy**:
- Prefer NO login for fast win
- If login needed: SSO, pre-fill fields, 1-click sample data
- First success must still be <2 min

### 3) 2-Step Opt-In Pattern (Recommended)
**When to Use** (boosts micro-commitment):
- ✅ Cold traffic (ads, SEO)
- ✅ Higher-commitment asks (demo, pricing access)
- ✅ Multi-field forms

**When to Skip** (show form immediately):
- Value is obvious/urgent (instant download)
- Audience is warm (retargeting, email list)
- One field only (email)
- Compliance requires all fields on same screen

**Implementation**:
- **Step 1**: Low-commitment button ("Yes, I Want [Outcome]") — no form visible
- **Step 2**: Reveal minimal form (name + email max)
  - Privacy line: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
  - Social proof: "1,427 people joined this week"
- **Step 3**: Instant Win (<120 sec) — template, demo, or sample output

### 4) Friction Analysis
- Form fields (minimize required fields)
- Steps to goal (reduce clicks/taps)
- Cognitive load (simplify decisions)
- Trust signals (social proof, security badges)

### 5) Fogg Behavior Model Application
- **Motivation** (benefits, pain relief, social proof)
- **Ability** (simplicity, time, effort)
- **Trigger** (call-to-action, notifications, prompts)

### 6) Additional Conversion Tactics
- Primary CTAs (high contrast, outcome-based copy)
- Secondary actions (subtle, low-commitment)
- Progress indicators (multi-step flows)
- Exit intent (save progress, offer help)
- Social proof (testimonials, user counts)

**Sources:** link to `/docs/research/UX-SOURCES-${TODAY}.md` (top 5 inline citations)

**Files to create/update**
- `/docs/ux/UX-DESIGN.md` (complete UX specification)
- `/docs/ux/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md` (design principles and guidelines)
- `/docs/journeys/USER-JOURNEYS.md` (all user journey maps)
- `/docs/journeys/STATE-COVERAGE.md` (empty/loading/error/success states)
- `/docs/ux/INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md` (IA and navigation structure)
- `/docs/ux/INTERFACE-PATTERNS.md` (UI patterns and interactions)
- `/docs/ux/ACCESSIBILITY.md` (WCAG 2.2 compliance checklist)
- `/docs/ux/RESPONSIVE.md` (breakpoints and mobile-first strategy)
- `/docs/ux/CONVERSION.md` (CRO tactics and Fogg Model)
- `/docs/research/UX-SOURCES-${TODAY}.md` (from Phase A)
- `/docs/design/UI-PROFILE.md` (UI profile source of truth for Steps 4/5/6/11)
- `/docs/design/ui-profile.json` (machine-readable UI profile)

**Quality gates (must pass)**
- User journeys cover **empty/loading/error/success** states for key screens.
- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** compliance checklist is complete.
- **Touch targets** are minimum 44x44px for mobile.
- **Color contrast** meets 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components.
- **Keyboard navigation** is fully specified with tab order.
- **Responsive breakpoints** are defined with mobile-first approach.
- **Conversion funnel** has measurable metrics (AARRR).
- **CTAs are outcome-based** (not "Submit", "Click Here", "Sign Up" alone).
- **Fast win** specified (≤120 sec post-opt-in value delivery).
- **2-step opt-in** pattern specified for high-friction forms.
- Research file has **5–10 credible sources** with URLs and dates.

**Heuristics Checklist (Hormozi Method)** - Self-verify before finalizing:
- [ ] **Readability**: Customer-facing copy targets F-K grade 5-8?
  - Use Hemingway Editor (hemingwayapp.com) or Readable (readable.com)
  - **F-K Score Calculator** (Node.js):
  ```javascript
  import { syllable } from 'syllable';
  const fk = (text) => {
    const sentences = (text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]+/g) || [text]).length;
    const words = (text.match(/\b\w+\b/g) || []).length;
    const syllables = (text.match(/\b\w+\b/g) || []).reduce((s,w)=>s+syllable(w),0);
    return 0.39*(words/sentences) + 11.8*(syllables/words) - 15.59;
  };
  // Target: 5-8 for customer-facing copy
  // Legal/TOS can exceed 8 but must include plain-English summary at 5-8
  ```
- [ ] **CTAs**: All buttons state outcomes, not actions? (e.g., "Get [Outcome]" vs. "Submit")
- [ ] **Fast Win**: ≤120 sec post-opt-in value specified?
- [ ] **2-Step Opt-In**: Recommended for cold traffic and high-friction forms?
- [ ] **Contrast**: WCAG AA passed (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)?
- [ ] **Touch Targets**: 44x44px minimum for mobile?


**Pass/Fail Notes**:
- ✅ Passed: [list items that passed]
- ❌ Failed: [list items needing fixes, e.g., "CTA on pricing page says 'Submit' instead of outcome"]
