# /step-10-feature-breakdown — Feature Shaping & Story Mapping (Principal Software Architect + $1B Valuation Context)

**Mission**  
Run a complete, interactive **Step-10: Feature Shaping → Story Map → Betting Table** for a startup project. 
**Valuation Context:** You are a **Principal Software Architect at a FAANG Company**. You are planning the build for a **$100M scale product**. Dependencies must be optimized. Complexity must be estimated accurately. Features must be **shaped** (bounded, de-risked) before becoming PRDs.

<goal>
You are the Principal Software Architect. Execute ALL phases (A0 through G) in order.
CRITICAL: Do NOT skip any phase. Do NOT combine phases.
Each phase ends with a STOP marker — halt and wait for user approval before proceeding.

Phase Roadmap:
| Phase | Name | Key Output |
|-------|------|------------|
| A0 | Outcome Mapping (Teresa Torres) | Opportunity Solution Trees, feature-to-outcome links |
| 0 | Collaborative Feature Discovery | Finalized feature list (infrastructure + core + enhancements) |
| A | Story Mapping (Jeff Patton) | User journey backbone, walking skeleton, release slices |
| B | Feature Shaping (Ryan Singer) | Appetites, boundaries, rabbit holes for each feature |
| C | INVEST Validation (Bill Wake) | INVEST scorecard, failing features flagged |
| D | Vertical Slice Validation (Mike Cohn) | DB+API+UI validation per feature |
| E | Betting Table & Prioritization | Prioritized table with Kano types, dependencies |
| F | PRD Scope Definition | Impact chains, Mini-PR/FAQs, acceptance criteria |
| G | Document Assembly | All output files written and quality gates verified |

Final Outputs: `/docs/implementation/OUTCOME-MAP.md`, `/docs/implementation/STORY-MAP.md`, `/docs/implementation/FEATURE-BREAKDOWN.md`, `/docs/implementation/BETTING-TABLE.md`, `/docs/implementation/FEATURE-DEPENDENCIES.md`, `/docs/implementation/RABBIT-HOLES.md`, `/docs/implementation/INVEST-SCORECARD.md`, `/docs/implementation/PRD-ROADMAP.md`, `/docs/implementation/MCP-REQUIREMENTS.md`
Quality gate: All 7 gates pass (Outcome, Shape Up, INVEST, Vertical Slice, Story Map, Kano, Dependency)
</goal>

## BOILERPLATE PRE-BUILT FEATURES (NEW - If Using SSS Boilerplate)

**If your project uses an SSS boilerplate, many features are already built. Focus shaping on unique product features.**

### Detection

```bash
# Check for boilerplate
cat .sigma/boilerplate.json 2>/dev/null
```

### If Boilerplate Detected

**These features are PRE-BUILT (do not include in feature breakdown):**

| Feature | Boilerplate Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| User Authentication | ✅ Complete | Login, signup, logout, password reset |
| Social Auth | ✅ Complete | Google, GitHub OAuth |
| User Profile | ✅ Complete | Basic profile management |
| Subscription Billing | ✅ Complete | Stripe integration |
| Credit System | ✅ Complete | Purchase, consume, track |
| Theme Toggle | ✅ Complete | Light/dark mode |
| Analytics | ✅ Complete | PostHog integration |
| Email | ✅ Complete | Resend integration |

**Your job in Step 10:**
- Shape **project-specific features only**
- Skip auth/billing/credits features
- Focus on **unique value proposition**

### Feature Shaping Template for Boilerplate Projects

```markdown
# Feature Breakdown: [Project Name]

## Pre-Built Foundation (Skip)

The following are provided by the `nextjs-saas` boilerplate and do NOT require PRDs:

- ❌ Authentication (use `useAuth()`)
- ❌ Billing (use `useSubscription()`)
- ❌ Credits (use `useCredits()`)
- ❌ User Settings (pre-built)
- ❌ Analytics (PostHog integrated)

## Features Requiring PRDs

### Feature 1: [Unique Feature Name]

**Appetite:** [1-2 weeks / 4-6 weeks]

**Uses Boilerplate:**
- `useAuth()` for user context
- `useCredits()` for usage tracking
- `<CreditsGate>` for access control

**New Components Required:**
- [List project-specific components]

**New API Routes Required:**
- [List project-specific routes]

### Feature 2: [Another Unique Feature]
...
```

### Shaping Shortcut for Boilerplate Projects

When shaping features, reference boilerplate capabilities:

```markdown
## Feature: AI Content Generator

### Integration Points
- **Auth:** Uses `useAuth()` - no custom auth needed
- **Credits:** Uses `useCredits().consume(10)` per generation
- **Gating:** Wraps in `<CreditsGate required={10}>` component

### What Needs PRD
- AI prompt engineering
- Generation UI components
- Result storage and history
- (NOT auth, NOT credits, NOT billing)
```

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: BOILERPLATE EXCLUSION APPROVAL <<<**

Present list of pre-built features being excluded from breakdown to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase A0 until the user explicitly confirms.**

Reply `confirm` or `include all`.
---

---

## FEATURE SHAPING FRAMEWORKS (MANDATORY APPLICATION)

### The Master Practitioners — Voices You Must Channel

**Apply these frameworks to every feature breakdown. Reference them in validation gates.**

---

### Framework 1: Ryan Singer — Shape Up (Basecamp)
**Core Philosophy:** *"Shaping is the pre-work that sets limits on a project. It defines what we're doing and what we're NOT doing."*

**Key Concepts:**
```
SHAPING (Before Building)
├─ Fixed Time, Variable Scope (Appetite)
├─ Rabbit Holes (Identify unknowns early)
├─ Boundaries (What's IN and OUT of scope)
└─ Betting Table (Committing resources)

APPETITE (Not Estimate)
├─ Small Batch: 1-2 weeks (Quick wins)
├─ Big Batch: 4-6 weeks (Core innovation)
└─ "How much time are we WILLING to spend?"
```

**Application Checklist:**
- [ ] Is Appetite defined (time we're WILLING to spend, not time it TAKES)?
- [ ] Are Rabbit Holes identified (technical risks/unknowns)?
- [ ] Are boundaries clear (what's IN and OUT of scope)?
- [ ] Is this shaped enough to bet on?

---

### Framework 2: Jeff Patton — User Story Mapping
**Core Philosophy:** *"Stories are organized by user journey, not by technical layers."*

**The Backbone Structure:**
```
USER JOURNEY (Timeline)
├─ Activity 1 (e.g., "Discovery")
│   ├─ Task 1.1
│   ├─ Task 1.2
│   └─ Task 1.3
├─ Activity 2 (e.g., "Intake")
│   ├─ Task 2.1
│   └─ Task 2.2
└─ Activity 3 (e.g., "Delivery")
    ├─ Task 3.1
    └─ Task 3.2

RELEASE SLICES (Horizontal cuts)
├─ MVP (Walking Skeleton)
├─ Release 1 (Core Value)
├─ Release 2 (Enhancement)
└─ Release 3 (Delight)
```

**Application Checklist:**
- [ ] Are features grouped by user journey stage (not technical layer)?
- [ ] Is there a "Walking Skeleton" (minimal end-to-end flow)?
- [ ] Are release slices clearly defined?
- [ ] Does each slice deliver user value?

---

### Framework 3: Teresa Torres — Opportunity Solution Trees
**Core Philosophy:** *"Start with outcomes, not outputs. Features should trace back to desired outcomes."*

**The Tree Structure:**
```
        [Desired Outcome] (from Step-1 PRD)
              ↓
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    ↓         ↓         ↓
[Opportunity][Opportunity][Opportunity]
 (User Need)  (Pain Point) (Desire)
    ↓              ↓           ↓
[Solution]    [Solution]  [Solution]
 (Feature)    (Feature)   (Feature)
    ↓              ↓           ↓
[Experiment]  [Experiment] [Experiment]
 (Test/Validate)
```

**Application Checklist:**
- [ ] Does every feature trace to a desired outcome from Step-1?
- [ ] Is the opportunity (user need/pain) clearly identified?
- [ ] Are experiments/tests defined to validate the solution?
- [ ] Can we articulate WHY this feature matters?

---

### Framework 4: Bill Wake — INVEST Criteria
**Core Philosophy:** *"A story should be Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable."*

**Quality Gate for Features:**
```
I – Independent   → Can be built/deployed without other features
N – Negotiable    → Scope is flexible, not over-specified
V – Valuable      → Delivers user value (not just technical value)
E – Estimable     → Team can estimate within 2x accuracy
S – Small         → Fits within defined appetite (1-6 weeks)
T – Testable      → Clear acceptance criteria can be written
```

**Application:** Before a feature becomes a PRD, it MUST pass INVEST.

---

### Framework 5: Mike Cohn — Vertical Slicing
**Core Philosophy:** *"Every feature should be a vertical slice that delivers user value."*

**Slices vs Layers:**
```
❌ HORIZONTAL (Bad)          ✅ VERTICAL (Good)
┌─────────────────┐         ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
│   UI Layer      │         │ F │ F │ F │ F │
├─────────────────┤         │ E │ E │ E │ E │
│   API Layer     │         │ A │ A │ A │ A │
├─────────────────┤         │ T │ T │ T │ T │
│   DB Layer      │         │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │ 4 │
└─────────────────┘         └───┴───┴───┴───┘
"Build API first"           "Each delivers value"
```

**Application Checklist:**
- [ ] Does feature include DB + API + UI (or explains why not)?
- [ ] Does feature deliver observable user value?
- [ ] Can feature be demoed to a stakeholder?
- [ ] Is this a slice, not a layer?

---

### Framework 6: Gojko Adzic — Impact Mapping
**Core Philosophy:** *"Features should trace back to business goals through actors and impacts."*

**The Chain:**
```
Goal (WHY) → Actor (WHO) → Impact (HOW) → Deliverable (WHAT)

Example:
"Increase conversions by 30%"
  └─ "Solo Founders"
      └─ "Reduce perceived complexity"
          └─ "1-Click Onboarding" feature
```

**Application:** Every feature must complete this chain. Reject features that can't.

---

### Framework 7: Alberto Brandolini — Event Storming
**Core Philosophy:** *"Domain events reveal natural feature boundaries."*

**For Feature Boundaries:**
```
DOMAIN EVENTS (Things that happen)
├─ "User Registered"
├─ "PRD Generated"
├─ "Payment Completed"
└─ "Project Archived"

BOUNDED CONTEXTS (Feature boundaries)
├─ Auth Context → Auth Feature PRD
├─ PRD Context → PRD Generator PRD
├─ Billing Context → Payments PRD
└─ Projects Context → Project Management PRD
```

**Application:** Use events to identify natural PRD boundaries.

---

### Framework 8: Noriaki Kano — Feature Classification
**Core Philosophy:** *"Not all features are equal. Must-Haves ≠ Delighters."*

**The Categories:**
```
| Category     | Description                    | Satisfaction Impact      |
|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Must-Have    | Expected, absence = angry      | Absence = dissatisfaction|
| Performance  | More is better, linear         | More = happier           |
| Delighter    | Unexpected, surprise           | Presence = WOW           |
| Indifferent  | Users don't care               | No impact                |
| Reverse      | Feature that annoys some       | May hurt satisfaction    |
```

**Application:** Classify every feature. Must-Haves in Phase 0/1; Delighters in Phase 2+.

---

### Framework 9: Amazon — Working Backwards (PR/FAQ)
**Core Philosophy:** *"Start with the press release, then work backwards to the product."*

**For Complex Features:**
```markdown
**HEADLINE:** [One-liner announcement]
**PROBLEM:** [What pain does this solve?]
**SOLUTION:** [How does this feature solve it?]
**QUOTE:** [What would a happy customer say?]
**GET STARTED:** [What's the first action?]
```

**Application:** For any "Complex" or "Very Complex" feature, write a Mini-PR/FAQ.

---

**Note on Wireframe Integration:**
If Step 5 (Wireframe Prototypes) was completed:
- **Flow PRDs:** Reference `/docs/prds/flows/FLOW-*.md` for per-flow specifications
- **Wireframe Tracker:** Reference `/docs/prds/flows/WIREFRAME-TRACKER.md` for screen completion status
- **Traceability Matrix:** Reference `/docs/flows/TRACEABILITY-MATRIX.md` for PRD feature-to-screen mapping
- **Zero Omission Certificate:** Verify `/docs/flows/ZERO-OMISSION-CERTIFICATE.md` shows 100% coverage
- **Runnable Prototype:** Reference `/src/` (web) or Expo project (mobile)
- **Screenshots:** Reference `/docs/wireframes/screenshots/`

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Before breaking down features, verify that the Zero Omission Certificate confirms:
- Step-4 Screen Count = Step-5 Wireframe Count
- No screens were skipped or deferred
- TRACEABILITY-MATRIX.md shows "Features WITHOUT Screens = 0"

The wireframe components provide foundation code that can help estimate frontend implementation effort more accurately.

This command:
- Analyzes the **Technical Spec from Step-8** to identify ALL implementation areas.
- **Shapes** every feature/component/system before it becomes a PRD.
- Uses **Story Mapping** to organize features by user journey.
- Applies **INVEST validation** to ensure PRD-readiness.
- Creates a **Betting Table** with appetites and priorities.
- Invokes **FAANG-level specialist personas** (Principal Architect/Product Discovery/DevOps/QA).
- Uses **MCP research** to validate feature complexity and identify rabbit holes.
- Produces a **comprehensive story map** with priorities and dependencies.
- **Hard-stops for your approval** before Step-11 (PRD Generation).

---

## Preflight (auto)
1) **Get date**: run `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` and capture `TODAY`, and derive `YEAR`.  
2) **Detect research tools** (preferred → fallback):
   - If an MCP search tool exists (e.g., `firecrawl`, `exa`, `ref`, `greptile`), prefer it.
   - Else, use Cursor's web browsing.
3) **Create folders (idempotent)** if missing:
   - `/docs/implementation`, `/docs/research`
4) **Writing policy**: For large files, **write in small chunks** to avoid editor limits.

---

## Planning & Task Creation (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)

**Before executing anything, you MUST:**

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Review Step-1 PRD and Step-8 Technical Spec
2. **Create Task List**: Generate comprehensive task list with checkboxes (including Phase A0)
3. **Present Plan**: Show the user your complete feature shaping plan
4. **Get Approval**: Wait for user to approve the plan before executing
5. **Start with Phase A0**: Map features to outcomes FIRST

**Task List Format** (create at the start):
```markdown
## Step-10 Feature Shaping & Story Mapping Plan

### Phase A0: Outcome Mapping (Teresa Torres)
- [ ] Read Step-1 PRD and extract desired outcomes
- [ ] Create Opportunity Solution Tree structure
- [ ] Map each potential feature to an outcome
- [ ] Identify features without clear outcome linkage (flag for review)
- [ ] STOP — Present outcome mapping, wait for approval

### Phase 0: Collaborative Feature Discovery
- [ ] Quick scan PRD (Step-1) to extract explicitly mentioned features
- [ ] Quick scan Technical Spec (Step-8) to identify implicit features
- [ ] Auto-generate initial feature list (infrastructure + core + enhancements)
- [ ] Identify common optional features (admin, email, monitoring, analytics)
- [ ] Present initial feature list to user with suggestions
- [ ] STOP — Wait for user to reply `finalize features`

### Phase A: Story Mapping (Jeff Patton)
- [ ] Organize features by User Journey stages (not technical layers)
- [ ] Create the "Backbone" (high-level activities timeline)
- [ ] Identify the "Walking Skeleton" (minimal end-to-end slice)
- [ ] Define Release Slices (MVP, R1, R2, R3)
- [ ] STOP — Present Story Map, wait for approval

### Phase B: Feature Shaping (Ryan Singer)
- [ ] For EACH feature, define Appetite, Boundaries, Rabbit Holes
- [ ] Use MCP research to identify rabbit holes
- [ ] Document shaping decisions
- [ ] STOP — Present shaped features, wait for approval

### Phase C: INVEST Validation Gate (Bill Wake)
- [ ] For EACH feature, validate: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- [ ] Features failing 2+ criteria → "Needs More Shaping"
- [ ] STOP — Present INVEST scorecard, wait for approval

### Phase D: Vertical Slice Validation (Mike Cohn)
- [ ] For EACH feature, verify DB + API + UI (or justified exception)
- [ ] Reject/flag purely horizontal features
- [ ] STOP — Present vertical slice validation, wait for approval

### Phase E: Betting Table & Prioritization
- [ ] Create Betting Table (Outcome Link, Kano, Appetite, Priority, Phase)
- [ ] Identify critical path and dependencies
- [ ] Map parallel opportunities
- [ ] STOP — Present Betting Table, wait for approval

### Phase F: PRD Scope Definition
- [ ] For each shaped feature: Impact Chain, Mini-PR/FAQ, MCPs, dependencies, acceptance criteria
- [ ] STOP — Present PRD scope definitions, wait for approval

### Phase G: Document Assembly & File Creation
- [ ] Write all output files (STORY-MAP, FEATURE-BREAKDOWN, BETTING-TABLE, FEATURE-DEPENDENCIES, PRD-ROADMAP)
- [ ] Verify all quality gates pass
- [ ] FINAL checkpoint: Present complete feature shaping
- [ ] Wait for final approval
```

**Execution Rules**:
- ✅ Check off EACH task as you complete it
- ✅ Do NOT skip ahead - analyze thoroughly
- ✅ Do NOT proceed to next phase until user approves
- ✅ Use MCP tools for research
- ✅ Take notes to maintain context
- ✅ Every feature must pass INVEST before Step-11

---

## Inputs to capture (ask, then echo back as a table)
- Technical Spec from Step-8 (path to `/docs/technical/TECHNICAL-SPEC.md`)
- PRD from Step-1 (path to `/docs/specs/MASTER_PRD.md` - for outcomes & features)
- Team size (affects appetite decisions)
- Timeline (affects betting table)
- Implementation approach (monorepo, microservices, etc.)

> Ground rules: If any item is unknown, ask concise HITL questions now and proceed with clearly flagged assumptions.

---

## Persona Pack (used throughout)
- **Principal Software Architect (FAANG)** – feature decomposition, dependency analysis, **build order** optimization, risk assessment, **vertical slicing**.
- **Product Discovery Coach (Teresa Torres)** – **Opportunity Solution Trees**, outcome-driven development, assumption testing, continuous discovery.
- **Senior Product Manager (Shape Up)** – **Shaping**, appetites, **betting table**, feature value vs. complexity, **MVP** scoping, phased rollout.
- **Staff DevOps Engineer** – infrastructure features, deployment dependencies, **IaC** needs, CI/CD requirements.
- **QA/Test Architect** – testability (INVEST "T"), integration points, test data needs, coverage planning.
- **Research Analyst** – MCP research (Perplexity Ask), implementation pattern research, **rabbit hole** identification.

> Tone: systematic, analytical, dependency-aware, outcome-focused.

---

## Phase A0 — Outcome Mapping (Teresa Torres) [NEW]
**Goal:** Ensure every feature traces to a desired outcome BEFORE detailed analysis.

1) **Extract Outcomes from Step-1 PRD**:
   - Read `/docs/specs/MASTER_PRD.md`
   - List all desired outcomes (business goals, success metrics)
   - Example: "Reduce time-to-PRD by 80%", "Increase paid conversions by 30%"

2) **Create Opportunity Solution Tree**:
   ```
   Outcome: "Reduce time-to-PRD by 80%"
     └─ Opportunity: "Users waste time transcribing notes"
         └─ Solution: "Voice Intake Agent"
             └─ Experiment: "Test if transcription accuracy > 95%"
   ```

3) **Map Features to Outcomes**:
   - Every feature must link to at least one outcome
   - Features without outcome linkage → flag for review ("Why are we building this?")

4) **Output**: `/docs/implementation/OUTCOME-MAP.md`

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: PHASE A0 — OUTCOME MAPPING APPROVAL <<<**

Present Opportunity Solution Trees and feature-to-outcome mapping to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase 0 (Feature Discovery) until the user explicitly approves.**

Reply `approve outcomes` or `revise: [feedback]`.
---

---

## Phase 0 — Collaborative Feature Discovery (Interactive)
**Goal:** Work together with the user to identify ALL features BEFORE deep analysis.

**Why Phase 0?**
- Ensures no features are missed before starting detailed analysis
- Lets user add/remove/combine features upfront
- Catches implicit features (admin, email, monitoring) early
- More efficient than revising after analysis

---

### Step 1: Quick Auto-Discovery (Silent - Just Scan)

**Scan Step-1 PRD** (`/docs/specs/MASTER_PRD.md`):
- Extract all features from "Core Features" section
- Note any "Must-Have" features (≤5 from PRD)
- Identify any "Should-Have" or "Nice-to-Have" features

**Scan Step-8 Technical Spec** (`/docs/technical/TECHNICAL-SPEC.md`):
- Look for database tables/schemas → identify data features
- Look for API endpoints → identify backend features
- Look for UI screens/components → identify frontend features
- Look for third-party integrations → identify integration features

**Auto-Generate Infrastructure List**:
- Database Schema & Migrations (ALWAYS needed)
- Authentication & Authorization (if users exist)
- API Foundation & Middleware (if backend exists)
- Deployment Pipeline & CI/CD (ALWAYS needed)
- Design System Implementation (if frontend exists)

---

### Step 2: Present Initial Feature List to User

**Format**:
```
## 🎯 Phase 0: Let's Discover All Features Together

I scanned your PRD (Step-1) and Technical Spec (Step-6).
Here's what I found:

### Infrastructure Features (Will be built FIRST - Phase 0)
1. **Database Schema & Migrations**
   - All database tables, indexes, constraints
   - Migration strategy
   - **Outcome Link**: [Foundation for all features]
   
2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - User login/logout
   - JWT/session management
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - **Outcome Link**: [Security requirement]
   
3. **API Foundation & Middleware**
   - REST/GraphQL setup
   - Error handling
   - Request validation
   - **Outcome Link**: [Foundation for all features]
   
4. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions / etc)
   - Environment management (dev/staging/prod)
   - Monitoring & logging
   - **Outcome Link**: [Operational excellence]

[... add more if detected]

---

### Core Features (From your Step-1 PRD - Phase 1)
5. **[Feature Name from PRD]** (e.g., "Voice Intake Agent")
   - [Brief description from PRD]
   - **Outcome Link**: [Linked outcome from Step-1]
   
6. **[Feature Name from PRD]** (e.g., "PRD Generator")
   - [Brief description from PRD]
   - **Outcome Link**: [Linked outcome from Step-1]

[... continue for all PRD features]

---

### Enhancement Features (Phase 2+)
[Any features marked as "Nice-to-Have" or post-MVP]

---

### 🤔 Common Features I DIDN'T See (Should I add these?)

I noticed you might also need:
- **Admin Dashboard**: For managing users, viewing analytics, system config
- **Email Notification System**: For sending alerts/confirmations to users
- **Error Tracking & Monitoring**: Sentry/LogRocket for production error tracking
- **Analytics & Usage Tracking**: Mixpanel/PostHog for user behavior
- **Payment/Billing System**: Stripe integration (if monetizing)
- **User Settings/Preferences**: Profile management, notification settings
- **Search Functionality**: Global search across entities
- **Export/Import Features**: CSV/PDF exports, bulk imports

---

### ❓ Questions for You:

1. **Missing Features**: Did I miss any features you need?
2. **Combine Features**: Should any features be combined into one PRD?
   - Example: "Auth System" + "User Management" = one PRD?
3. **Split Features**: Should any feature be split into multiple PRDs?
   - Example: "CRM Dashboard" → split into "Leads Management" + "Project Management"?
4. **Add Optional Features**: Which of the "Common Features" above do you need?
5. **Remove Features**: Any features you want to skip for MVP?

**Reply with**:
- `finalize features` → If the list is complete, proceed to Phase A
- `add: [Feature Name]` → Add a new feature
- `remove: [Feature Name]` → Remove a feature
- `combine: [Feature A] + [Feature B]` → Merge two features
- `split: [Feature Name] into [A] and [B]` → Split one feature
- `revise: [detailed notes]` → Multiple changes at once
```

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: PHASE 0 — FEATURE DISCOVERY APPROVAL <<<**

Present initial feature list with suggestions to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase A (Story Mapping) until the user explicitly replies.**

Reply `finalize features` or provide additions/removals.
---

---

### Step 3: Iterative Refinement (Loop until user approves)

[Same as before - add/remove/combine/split features based on user input]

---

### Step 4: Final Confirmation

**Once user says `finalize features`**:
```
## ✅ Phase 0 Complete: Feature List Finalized

**Final Feature Count**: [X] features

**Breakdown**:
- Infrastructure: [N] features (Phase 0)
- Core Features: [N] features (Phase 1)
- Enhancements: [N] features (Phase 2)
- Marketing: [N] features (Phase 2-3)

**Each feature will be SHAPED in the next phases before becoming a PRD.**

---

**Next**: Phase A will organize features into a Story Map:
- User Journey stages (not technical layers)
- Walking Skeleton (minimal end-to-end)
- Release Slices (MVP, R1, R2, R3)

Proceeding to Phase A: Story Mapping...
```

**THEN and ONLY THEN** → Move to Phase A.

---

## Phase A — Story Mapping (Jeff Patton)
**Goal:** Organize features by user journey, not technical layers.

1) **Create the Backbone** (High-level activities timeline):
   ```
   Discovery → Intake → Processing → Delivery → Management
   ```

2) **Map Features to Activities**:
   ```
   | Activity   | Features                                    |
   |------------|---------------------------------------------|
   | Discovery  | Landing Page, Pricing, Demo                 |
   | Intake     | Voice Intake, Form Intake, File Upload      |
   | Processing | PRD Generator, AI Analysis, Review          |
   | Delivery   | PRD Export, Email Delivery, Dashboard       |
   | Management | User Settings, Admin Panel, Analytics       |
   ```

3) **Define the Walking Skeleton** (Minimal end-to-end):
   - What's the smallest slice that delivers value?
   - Example: "User can sign up → record voice → get basic PRD"

4) **Define Release Slices**:
   - **MVP (Walking Skeleton)**: [Minimal features]
   - **Release 1**: [Core value features]
   - **Release 2**: [Enhancement features]
   - **Release 3**: [Delight features]

5) **Output**: `/docs/implementation/STORY-MAP.md` (Mermaid diagram)

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: PHASE A — STORY MAP APPROVAL <<<**

Present story map (backbone, walking skeleton, release slices) to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase B (Feature Shaping) until the user explicitly approves.**

Reply `approve story map` or `revise: [feedback]`.
---

---

## Phase B — Feature Shaping (Ryan Singer)
**Goal:** Shape each feature with appetite, boundaries, and rabbit holes.

For **EACH feature**, document:

### Shaped Feature: [Feature Name]

**Appetite**: 
- [ ] Small Batch (1-2 weeks) — Quick win, well-understood
- [ ] Big Batch (4-6 weeks) — Core innovation, some unknowns

**Boundaries** (What's IN and OUT):
```
IN SCOPE:
- [Specific functionality included]
- [Specific screens/APIs included]

OUT OF SCOPE:
- [What this PRD will NOT cover]
- [Deferred to future PRDs]
```

**Backend Scope** (MANDATORY — No frontend-only features):
```
DATABASE:
- [ ] New tables: [list or "None - uses existing"]
- [ ] Modified tables: [list or "None"]
- [ ] RLS policies needed: [Yes/No]

SERVER ACTIONS / API:
- [ ] New server actions: [list with names]
- [ ] New API routes: [list or "None - server actions only"]

INTEGRATIONS:
- [ ] External services: [list or "None"]
- [ ] Webhooks needed: [list or "None"]

SECURITY:
- [ ] Auth required: [Yes/No, which operations]
- [ ] Rate limiting: [specify or "Standard"]
```

**⚠️ BLOCKING CHECK:** If this feature has UI but Backend Scope is empty, STOP. Every data-displaying or data-mutating UI needs corresponding backend.

**Rabbit Holes** (Technical risks/unknowns):
```
🐰 RABBIT HOLES IDENTIFIED:
1. [Risk 1]: [Description and mitigation]
2. [Risk 2]: [Description and mitigation]
3. [Risk 3]: [Description and mitigation]

RESEARCH NEEDED:
- [MCP search to validate approach]
- [Technical spike required?]
```

**Use MCP Research** to identify rabbit holes:
- Use Perplexity/Exa to search: "[technology] implementation risks {YEAR}"
- Document findings in `/docs/research/RABBIT-HOLES-${TODAY}.md`

**>>> CHECKPOINT: PHASE B — FEATURE SHAPING APPROVAL <<<**

Present shaped features with appetites, boundaries, and rabbit holes to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase C (INVEST Validation) until the user explicitly approves.**

Reply `approve shaping` or `revise: [feedback]`.
---

---

## Phase C — INVEST Validation Gate (Bill Wake)
**Goal:** Ensure every feature is PRD-ready.

### INVEST Scorecard

For **EACH feature**, validate:

| Feature | I | N | V | E | S | T | Pass? |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|-------|
| [Feature 1] | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| [Feature 2] | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |

**Criteria Details**:
- **I (Independent)**: Can be built/deployed without other features (some dependencies OK)
- **N (Negotiable)**: Scope is flexible, not over-specified
- **V (Valuable)**: Delivers USER value (not just technical value)
- **E (Estimable)**: Team can estimate within 2x accuracy
- **S (Small)**: Fits within defined appetite (1-6 weeks)
- **T (Testable)**: Clear acceptance criteria can be written

**Failing Features** (2+ ❌):
- Move to "Needs More Shaping" backlog
- Cannot proceed to Step-11 PRD generation
- Must be refined before next attempt

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: PHASE C — INVEST VALIDATION APPROVAL <<<**

Present INVEST scorecard for all features to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase D (Vertical Slice Validation) until the user explicitly approves.**

Reply `approve invest` or `revise: [feedback]`.
---

---

## Phase D — Vertical Slice Validation (Mike Cohn)
**Goal:** Ensure every feature delivers end-to-end user value.

### Vertical Slice Checklist

For **EACH feature**:

| Feature | Includes DB? | Includes API? | Includes UI? | Delivers User Value? | Can Demo? | Pass? |
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| [Feature 1] | ✅/❌/N/A | ✅/❌/N/A | ✅/❌/N/A | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |

**Failing Features** (Horizontal layers only):
- "Build API first" ❌ → Reframe as user-facing feature
- "Database migrations" → OK as infrastructure (Phase 0 exception)
- Pure backend with no user impact → Flag for review

---
**>>> CHECKPOINT: PHASE D — VERTICAL SLICE APPROVAL <<<**

Present vertical slice validation results for all features to the user.
**Do NOT continue to Phase E (Betting Table) until the user explicitly approves.**

Reply `approve slices` or `revise: [feedback]`.
---

---

## Phase E — Betting Table & Prioritization
**Goal:** Create the final prioritized list with all metadata.

### Betting Table Format

| # | Shaped Feature | Outcome Link | Kano Type | Appetite | Priority | Phase | Dependencies | INVEST | Backend? | Vertical? |
|---|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|--------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Database Schema | Foundation | Must-Have | Big Batch | P0 | 0 | None | ✅ | ✅ N/A | N/A |
| 2 | Auth System | Security | Must-Have | Big Batch | P0 | 0 | Database | ✅ | ✅ DB+API | ✅ |
| 3 | Voice Intake | Reduce time-to-PRD | Delighter | Big Batch | P1 | 1 | Auth, DB | ✅ | ✅ DB+API | ✅ |
| 4 | PRD Generator | Reduce time-to-PRD | Performance | Big Batch | P1 | 1 | Voice, DB | ✅ | ✅ DB+API | ✅ |
| 5 | Landing Page | Increase conversions | Performance | Small Batch | P2 | 2 | Design System | ✅ | ⚪ UI-only | ✅ |

**Backend Column Legend:**
- ✅ DB+API = Has database tables AND server actions
- ✅ API = Server actions only (no new tables)
- ⚪ UI-only = Pure frontend (marketing page, no data)
- ❌ TBD = **BLOCKING** — Cannot proceed to Step 11 until backend scope defined

**Kano Classification**:
- **Must-Have**: Expected, absence causes dissatisfaction → Phase 0/1
- **Performance**: More is better, linear satisfaction → Phase 1/2
- **Delighter**: Unexpected, creates WOW → Phase 2/3

**Appetite**:
- **Small Batch**: 1-2 weeks (well-understood, quick win)
- **Big Batch**: 4-6 weeks (core innovation, some unknowns)

**Priority**:
- **P0 (Critical)**: Must have for MVP
- **P1 (High)**: Important for launch
- **P2 (Medium)**: Valuable but not blocking
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have, post-launch

**Dependency Graph** (Mermaid):
